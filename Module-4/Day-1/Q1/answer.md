# Web Application Basics

## Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

Frontend is the part of a web application that the user can see and use directly. It focuses on how the website looks and how users interact with it.

### User Interface
Frontend is responsible for designing the layout of the website. It includes buttons, forms, text, images, colors, and menus. A good frontend makes the website easy and comfortable to use.

### User Interaction
Frontend handles user actions like clicking a button, typing in a form, selecting options, or scrolling a page. It shows messages, alerts, and updates the screen based on user actions.

### Communication with Backend
Frontend sends requests to the backend to get or send data such as login details or product information. It receives the response and displays the data properly to the user.

## Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

Backend is the hidden part of a web application that works behind the scenes. Users do not see it, but it is very important.

### Server-Side Processing
Backend processes the requests coming from the frontend. It performs calculations, checks conditions, and applies rules before sending a response.

### Database Handling
Backend stores data in databases and retrieves it when needed. For example, saving user details, order information, or login data.

### Security and Authentication
Backend manages user login, signup, password security, and access control. It ensures that only authorized users can access protected data.

## Q3. Business Logic

Business Logic refers to the rules and conditions that decide how a web application should work. It controls the behavior of the application based on real-world requirements.

### Real-World Examples

#### Online Shopping Website
- Apply discounts during sales
- Check stock before placing an order
- Calculate total price including tax

#### Banking Application
- Allow money transfer only if balance is sufficient
- Limit the number of daily transactions

#### Online Exam System
- Automatically submit the exam when time is over
- Calculate marks based on correct answers

Business logic ensures the application works correctly and follows business rules.

## Q4. Client–Server Model

The Client–Server Model is a system where work is divided between the client and the server.

### Client
The client is the user’s device or application, such as a web browser or mobile app. It sends requests to the server.

### Server
The server is a system that receives requests, processes them, and sends responses. It stores data and runs backend logic.

### Communication
The client sends a request through the internet, the server processes it, and then sends the required data or result back to the client.

## Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

Three-Tier Architecture divides a web application into three separate layers.

### 1. Presentation Layer
This is the frontend layer. It shows the user interface and collects user input.

### 2. Application (Business) Layer
This layer contains the business logic. It processes requests and applies rules.

### 3. Data Layer
This layer manages the database where all data is stored and retrieved.

### Why it is used
- Easy maintenance
- Better security
- Clear separation of work
- Scalable applications

## Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is commonly used as a backend language because it is fast and flexible.

### Performance
JavaScript supports asynchronous and non-blocking operations, which helps handle multiple users efficiently.

### Ecosystem
JavaScript has a large ecosystem with many libraries and tools available through npm.

### Popular Backend Frameworks
- Node.js
- Express.js
- NestJS

Using JavaScript on both frontend and backend makes development easier and faster.
